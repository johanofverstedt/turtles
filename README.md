# turtles
The Turtle- and World-classes lets the student begin to learn Java-programming by experimenting
with objects, methods, parameters, variables in a visual setting as they move the turtles around in the world.
This implementation is new but the idea is a classic in computer science education.

The reason for producing this piece of code is to make a self-contained pair of files which
are easy for the students to download, run and make simple modifications to.
(Without having to mess around with classpath and other uninspiring concepts at the beginning
of the journey which is a delicate time.)

If you don't want to download the whole repository, just grab src/World.java and src/Turtle.java.
They are all you need really if you don't want javadoc documentation and other misc things.

All the material in this repository is licensed under the ISC-license which basically lets
you do whatever you want with it as long as you don't blame me for anything. :)
